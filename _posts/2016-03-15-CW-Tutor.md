I have open-sourced a fairly comprehensive morse code tutor I have written (and used) in the Ruby language. It goes by the name of **CW**.

In case you were wondering, **CW** stands for *Continuous Wave*. When communicating by morse code you are effectively interrupting a *continuous-wave* signal with a key to generate dots and dashes. For this reason, the name *CW* became synonymous with morse code.

## DSL

The tutor is in the form of domain-specific language and a couple of simple *CW* test examples are shown below:

<hr>
### Ex.1 Play a daily quotation from an rss feed (18 words per minute / 12 effective words per minute)

```ruby
require 'cw'

cw do
  comment 'read daily quotation via RSS feed (1 article)'
  read_rss(:quotation, 1)
  wpm 18
  ewpm 12
end

```

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  <audio controls="" preload="meta">
    <source src="/blog/audio/rss_feed.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
      <a href="/blog/audio/rss_feed.mp3">/blog/audio/rss_feed.mp3</a>
  </audio>
</div>
<hr>

### Ex.2 Play eight words having five or less letters (18 words per minute)

```ruby
require 'cw'

cw do
  comment "Eight words, five or less letters (18 WPM)"
  shuffle
  no_longer_than 5
  word_count     8
  wpm            18
end

```

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  <audio controls="" preload="meta">
    <source src="/blog/audio/range_of_word_lengths_3.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
      <a href="/blog/audio/range_of_word_lengths_3.mp3">/blog/audio/range_of_word_lengths_3.mp3</a>
  </audio>
</div>
<hr>

## Documention

I have documented **CW** using the excellent **Jekyll** *static website generator*, and a theme called *Documentation theme jekyll*.
