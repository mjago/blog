Here is an automated pub ale menu I created with the **Ruby** language, using the **Sinatra** framework, and some javascript. As ales are tapped and available for serving they appear on the *blackboard* as shown, complete with *type*, *ABV*, and *price*. Ales are entered into the system as they are *tapped*. This can trigger an update of a website containing a page showing the *blackboard*.

## BatmanJS

### **Update: Unfortunately the BatmanJS library is no longer maintained**

The batman javascript library was used to create the *blackboard* update mechanism. The *blackboard* itself is designed to be displayed on a suitable large flat-screen TV, and can be used for other marketing and sport display too.
