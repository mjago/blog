I recently came across this interview with the remarkable English drummer / keyboard player **Gary Husband**.

As a long-time Allan Holdsworth fan I have been aware of Gary's playing for many years, and have seen him play live both with Allan Holdsworth, and with his own lineup.

In this interview he talks with great warmth and insight about working with the late, great Allan Holdsworth. The interviewer is Rick Beato, whose [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/pegzch) is a mine of interesting and useful information on music theory, with an emphasis on jazz and guitar improvisation.
