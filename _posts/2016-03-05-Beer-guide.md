##
This is an automated pub _blackboard_ I created with the Sinatra framework and javascript. As beers are put onto the bar they appear on the _blackboard_ as shown, complete with beer type, ABV, and price. Beers may be entered into the system as they are _tapped_, which can trigger an update of a pub website containing a page showing the _blackboard_, or additionally club members may be sent an email of the latest beers to be _coming soon_.

## BatmanJS

The **batmanJS** javascript library was used to create the _blackboard_ update mechanism. The _blackboard_ itself is designed to be displayed on a suitable large flat-screen TV, and could clearly be used for other marketing and sport display too.
